# Ngok.sh

# Ngrok for automatisation

this shell script automatically downloads and sets up ngrok and keeps it running no matter what

to use it copy and paste this command:

> curl ngrok.surge.sh/ngrok.sh | bash

this only supports Linux. It should work on all major distributions. Curl is required
